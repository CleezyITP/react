# "React" Assignment

h3. Part II (UX Study)

For this assignment, I performed a mini user experience (UX) study with 3 of my coworkers.  
I did not give any explanation of what the site they were looking at was, and invited them to interact with last week's version of the page, while vocalizing their experience. I took notes during the process and finally, asked them questions about their experience afterwards. 

h3. User 1

Quotes:
"What?!?"
"Am I clicking the images?"

Notes:
From the conversation that followed this user test, it became clear that the purpose of the site was very unclear. The user reported that the instructions were vague and the images did not have clear meanings either. 

h3. User 2

Quotes:
"Huh?!?"
"What is this crap?!?"

Notes:
This user was particularly flustered with the lack of context on the page. He observed that the header did not clarify what the purpose of the site was. 


h3. User 3

Quotes:
"I'll choose this one because I am a data man, myself"
"oh, i like the heart one"

Notes:
This user chose images somewhat arbitrarily. He gravitated to pictures he found pleasing and not in relation to the question asked, or the content of the images.



Decisions:

I decided to rethink the title of the page and instead of "What to do?", renamed it, "How to Avoid Immigration Scams."
I reworded the questions and reformatted the layout to ensure that it is clearer what is being asked for.
